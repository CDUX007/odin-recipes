# odin-recipes
pre-project: This is my first TOP project where I will be creating a recipe website using the skills I have gained from the foundations course so far  
post-project: Really enjoyed this project. Went back to a few lessons to remind myself how to do a few things. Knew there must be an easier way to write out a list in VSCode, and then get it to bulk update with <li></li> tags - worked SUPER well!

Skills demonstrated
- Create, and launch online via GitHub, my very first webpage - how COOL! (https://cdux007.github.io/odin-recipes/index.html)
- Create index.html boilerplate without using VSCode default
- Create new pages and connect with relative links
- Add headings, images with a defined size as well as unordered and ordered lists
- Confidence to Google an easier way to do something
